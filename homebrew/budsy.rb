# Homebrew Cask for Budsy (previously "Galaxy Buds for Mac").
#
# Setup (one time):
#   1. Create a public repo named "homebrew-tap" on your GitHub account.
#   2. Put this file at "Casks/budsy.rb" in that repo.
#   3. Copy "tap_migrations.json" (next to this file) to the tap repo root so
#      users of the old "galaxy-buds" cask are redirected to "budsy".
#   4. Copy this file into that repo whenever it changes.
#
# On every release: bump `version` and paste the new `sha256` (package.sh
# prints it after building the .dmg), then commit to the tap repo.
#
# Users then install with:
#   brew install --cask vedatkilic/tap/budsy
